# Model Order Reduction

The numerical simulation of mathematical models described by partial
differential equations (PDEs) or large systems of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) is nowadays an important tool for research in almost every
scientific discipline.
Yet, the use of such models is often limited by the available computational
resources.

Over the last decade, a variety of algorithms have been developed which compute,
for a given numerical ODE/PDE model, a mathematically certified surrogate that
can be simulated in a small fraction of the time required for the solution of
the original model.
These techniques, known as model order reduction (MOR), are now becoming an
integral part in many simulation workflows which otherwise would be infeasible,
even on the largest available supercomputers.

See the [MOR Wiki](https://morwiki.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/morwiki) for more
information.

# pyMOR

[pyMOR](https://pymor.org) is a free software library for building model order
reduction applications with the Python programming language.
Implemented algorithms include reduced basis methods as well as system-theoretic
methods.
Some of the available methods are:

- Greedy basis generation,
- Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD),
- Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM),
- POD-Greedy,
- Balanced Truncation,
- Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm (IRKA),
- models based on artificial neural networks,
- Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD).

All algorithms in pyMOR are formulated in terms of abstract interfaces for
seamless integration with external PDE solver packages.
Currently, there is support for [deal.II](https://dealii.org),
[DUNE](https://dune-project.org), [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org), and
[NGSolve](https://ngsolve.org).
Custom (domain specific) solvers can be easily integrated with pyMOR.
Moreover, pure Python implementations of FEM (Finite Element Method) and FVM
(Finite Volume Method) discretizations using the
[NumPy](https://numpy.org)/[SciPy](https://scipy.org) scientific computing stack
are provided for getting started quickly.

# pyMOR School

The pyMOR School is the fourth event for current and future pyMOR users and
developers.
It will take place at the
[Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de)
from Monday noon (August 22nd) to Friday noon (August 26th).

The School will consist of introductory lectures on the MOR methods available in
pyMOR combined with interactive pyMOR tutorial and exercise sessions.
Further, participants are encouraged to bring their own projects to work on
during the school with the support of the pyMOR developers.

# Organizers

The pyMOR School 2022 is organized by:

- Linus Balicki (Virginia Tech)
- René Fritze (WWU Münster)
- Hendrik Kleikamp (WWU Münster)
- Petar Mlinarić (Virginia Tech)
- Stephan Rave (WWU Münster)
- Jens Saak (MPI Magdeburg)
